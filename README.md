Project Description:
My project is a GPA calculator tool designed to help students manage their academic performance. It allows users to input their current GPA, cumulative credits, and details of courses taken in the current semester. The program calculates and displays the user's current GPA. Additionally, users can choose to calculate the GPA they need to achieve a target GPA for future semesters by inputting their target GPA and the number of credits for planned courses. This tool aims to provide students with clarity on their academic standing and assist in planning for future academic goals.
